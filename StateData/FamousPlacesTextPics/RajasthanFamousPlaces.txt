<p style = "margin-left:30px">The land of legendary Rajputanas are calling you with all its glory and history. Visit the forts at Udaipur and Chittor, where stories of legendary Rana Pratap and Meera Bai are encrypted. Get through Rajasthani Folks, the basic of Classical Raga. Do not forget to visit the Pink City Jaipur and the Aravalli at Mount Abu. The state is having wonderful beauty although surrounded by the great Thar Desert at West. Visit Baluchistan and Jaisalmer, with all its golden arts. Glittering gold in the Morning sun will help you identify the deer and peacocks in numbers. Best time to visit this top destination in the month of October and November. Also, December is good, but not preferred by many.

Jaipur is the Major city of Rajasthan</p>
