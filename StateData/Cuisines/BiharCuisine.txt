<h2>Bihari cuisine:
</h2>


<p>Bihari cuisine is eaten mainly in Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, some cities of Pakistan, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Jamaica, and the Caribbean, as these are the places where Bihari people are present. 
Bihari cuisine is predominantly vegetarian because traditional Bihar society, influenced by Buddhist and Hindu values of non-violence, did not eat eggs, chicken, fish and other animal products. 
However, there is also a tradition of meat-eating, and fish dishes are especially common due to the number of rivers in Bihar, such as the Sone, Gandak and Ganges. There are also numerous Bihari meat dishes, with chicken and mutton being the most common.</p>



<h2>Bihari thali:</h2>


<p>As the seasons change so does the Bihari thaali, every 3–4 months.The constants are rice, roti, achar, chatni, dals and milk products with some variation.

People use both vegetable oil or mustard oil and zeera (cumin) or panchforan (literally "five seeds"), namely saunf, sarson, methi, ajwain and mangraeel (Kalaunji) for "chhounkna"/"Tadka"(tempering) of some vegetables. 
There is a lot of light frying, called bhoonjnaa, in Bihari food.

One of the most remarkable thing about this cuisine is "smoked food". It refers to using smoked red chilli to infuse a strong aroma in food. It is used in preparing "chokhaa", i.e. mashed brinjals/potatoes/tomatoes, either single or combined.</p>
