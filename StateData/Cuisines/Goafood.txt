Bebinca This is Goa's most famous sweet. This dessert is a multi-layered cake made from egg, coconut milk, sugar and ghee. Cooking a perfect bebinca is considered an art form. A lot of patience is needed at the time of its preparation as the next layer can only be added once the previous layer has been cooked. Each layer is cooked in the oven until it has a light fudge consistency. This can be eaten hot or cold and is traditionally served at Christmas.</p>
