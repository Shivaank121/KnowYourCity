<ul> Arunachal Pradesh food differs from tribe to tribe. As you move toward the eastern side of Arunachal people are dependent on bamboo and other leafy vegetables which are strictly boiled. Fried food is not very popular as people like to eat either boiled or smoked food.

<li> <h3> Rice: </h3>
Rice is a staple product in Arunachal Pradesh food, and any other food is just a side dish. The main source of food anywhere is Rice but in Arunachal it is more focused. The most important and different thing about their rice is that the Arunachalis prefer to cook their rice in the hollow bamboo over some hot coal to give it a different flavour than other types of rice. 
<li><h3>Bamboo Shoot:</h3>
Bamboo shoot is widely eaten through all the North Eastern States because of its delicate flavor and is a chief component of Arunachal Pradesh food. I don't know if you have noticed but the Arunachalis use Bamboo shoot in almost every dish they make it is the main ingredient without which their food would be left incomplete.
<li> <h3>Pika Pila:</h3>
Pika pila is a famous type of a pickle that is mostly made by the Apatani tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. It is a favorite dish of Arunachal Pradesh Food and Cuisine.
Pika Pila is a type of a pickle that is made by using bamboo shoot and pork fat with a little addition of King Chilly. It is hot but not very spicy as to make you feel sick.
<li> <h3>Lukter:</h3>
Another delicacy of the Arunachal Pradesh Food is the Lukter. Nothing complicated, Lukter is a combination of cooked dry meat and chilly flakes from the King chilly or Bhut Jolokia. Like the norm goes with Arunachal, this too is just a side dish meant to be eaten with the rice.
