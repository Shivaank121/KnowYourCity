<p style="padding:38px">When it comes to vacationing, not many think of Karnataka at the first instance, the reason being less popularisation of the destinations in the state.
 However, Karnataka has many places you can pay your visit to and you will certainly end up spending some memorable time there. 
So, let us take a quick look at the places to visit in our next tourist destination.</p>

<ul>
<li><h2>Bangalore</h2>
Known as the 'garden city', Bangalore is one of the most upwardly mobile city in Asia. 
It's known for its beautiful gardens, gigantic malls, well designed arcades, exotic art galleries, majestic palaces, forts and shrines.

<li><h2>Mysore</h2>

Mysore is the cultural capital and the second largest city of Karnataka. Many Indian arts and crafts were born in this city. 
Mysore is situated about 139 km away from Bangalore. It was the capital of Karnataka earlier. India's richest silk saris are woven here. History of Karnataka says that Mysore had been the capital of Wodeyars before going into the hands of Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. As a result, we find the acculturation of the native trends as the style of these Sultans.

<li><h2>Mangalore</h2>

Located between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, Mangalore has remained important since the time of the ancient kingdoms of Chalukyas, Mauryas, Hoysalas besides many more. 
The serene beaches, beautiful mountains and temples are not to be missed when you are in Mangalore.

<li><h2>Hampi</h2>

Talking about the genesis of Hampi, it can be said that it is a site where the mythological Kishkindha was stationed. It is said that Hampi was formed by the Vijaynagar kings between 1336 and 1565. Some of the important locations worth seeing in Hampi are Virupaksha Temple and the Archaeological Museum.

<li><h2>Nandi Hills</h2>

A hilltop with an ancient fortress is what describes the Nandi Hills. 

<li><h2>Belur</h2>

The Hasan dominion of Karnataka is regarded as the holy abode of innumerable architectural marvels that bear the robust trademark of Hoysala dynasty. One such shrine situated in Belur that reflects the genius and adeptness of the master builders of the Hoysalan era is the 'Chennakesava Temple'. Roughly translated the Chennakesava temple means the 'Vishnu with stunning looks'.
The Chennakesava Temple can easily be identified as the chief attraction of Belur.

<li><h2>Halebid</h2>

It was Halebid that served as the imperial capital of the glorious Hoysala province in the midst of the 12th century. Being located in Hasan district and approximately 149 kms away from Mysore, Halebid is conveniently approachable from any distant nook of the state. The Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebid is flanked by a pristine lake that gifts a heavenly feel to it. 

<li><h2>Badami</h2>

Badami is also known as Vatapi and considered as a hub for tourists as it is enriched by the prized presence of the Chalukyan architecture. Legend has it that Badami had to see the ugly face of defeat at the hands of Narhasimhavarma Pallavan, a celebrated ruler belonging to the Pallava dynasty. However, it took 12 years for the Chalukyas to turn the tables on the Pallavas and seize what rightfully belonged to them.
